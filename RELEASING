= Noosfero release tasks

This file documents release-related activities.

== Working with translations

* Update translation files: <tt>rake updatepo</tt>. Then <tt>git commit</tt> them.
* Send the PO files to the translators.
* Get the PO files back from translators, put in po/ under the correct language
  name (e.,g. po/pt_BR/) and <tt>git commit</tt>.
* test translations: <tt>rake makemo</tt> and browse the application on the web.

== Releasing noosfero

Considering you are on a Debian GNU/Linux or Debian-based system
 # apt-get install devscripts debhelper

To prepare a release of noosfero, you must follow the steps below:

* Finish all requirements and bugs assigned to the to-be-released version
* Make sure all tests pass
* Change the version in lib/noosfero.rb and debian/changelog to the
  to-be-released version (e.g. 0.2.0, 0.3.1)
* Write release notes at the version's wiki topic
* Generate packages with <tt>rake noosfero:release</tt>. Your tarball and deb
  pkg will be under the pkg/ directory. This task will create a git tag too.
* Test that the tarball and deb package are ok
* Go to the version's wiki topic and edit it to reflect the new reality
* Edit the topic WebPreferences and update DEBIAN_REPOSITORY_TOPICS setting
* Attach the generated packages to that topic. Before attaching calculate the
  sha1 of the package (with sha1sum and paste the SHA1 hash as comment in the
  attachment form)
* Download the attached and verify the MD5 hash
* Update an eventual demonstration version that you run.
* Write an announcement e-mail to the relevant mailing lists pointing to the
  release notes, and maybe to the demonstration version.

If you had any problem during these steps, you can do <tt>rake clobber_package</tt> to
completely delete the generated packages and start the process again.
